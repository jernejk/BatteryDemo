[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/455qgm3d62w5e77b/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jernejk/batterydemo/branch/master)

Demo projects for using battery data on UWP (W10), Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, WPF and console.

Warning: Windows 8.1 does not use permitted Win32 API which is why it may not pass certification! No known workaround...
